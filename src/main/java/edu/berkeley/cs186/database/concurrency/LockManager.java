/**
 * LockManager maintains the bookkeeping for what transactions have what locks
 * on what resources and handles queuing logic. The lock manager should generally
 * NOT be used directly: instead, code should call methods of LockContext to
 * acquire/release/promote/escalate locks.
 *
 * The LockManager is primarily concerned with the mappings between
 * transactions, resources, and locks, and does not concern itself with multiple
 * levels of granularity. Multigranularity is handled by LockContext instead.
 *
 * Each resource the lock manager manages has its own queue of LockRequest
 * objects representing a request to acquire (or promote/acquire-and-release) a
 * lock that could not be satisfied at the time. This queue should be processed
 * every time a lock on that resource gets released, starting from the first
 * request, and going in order until a request cannot be satisfied. Requests
 * taken off the queue should be treated as if that transaction had made the
 * request right after the resource was released in absence of a queue (i.e.
 * removing a request by T1 to acquire X(db) should be treated as if T1 had just
 * requested X(db) and there were no queue on db: T1 should be given the X lock
 * on db, and put in an unblocked state via Transaction#unblock).
 *
 * This does mean that in the case of:
 *    queue: S(A) X(A) S(A)
 * only the first request should be removed from the queue when the queue is
 * processed.
